Remote work refers to any work that is done outside of a traditional office setting. This can include working from home, a coffee shop, or any other location that is not a physical office. Remote work can be full-time or part-time, and can be done by employees or independent contractors.

There are different forms of remote work, including:

* Full-time remote work: where the employee works entirely from a remote location.
* Partial remote work: where the employee splits their time between the office and a remote location.
* Freelance remote work: where the worker is an independent contractor who works remotely for multiple clients.
* Digital nomadism: where the worker travels while working remotely.

Each form of remote work comes with its own set of challenges and benefits.
